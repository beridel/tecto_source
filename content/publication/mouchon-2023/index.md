abstract: "Geodetic positioning is the geophysical record of reference for slow slip events, but typical daily solutions limit studies of the evolution of slow slip to its long-term dynamics. Accompanying seismic low-frequency earthquakes located precisely in time and space provide an opportunity to image slow slip dynamics at subdaily time scales. Here we show that a high-resolution time history of low-frequency earthquake fault slip alone can reproduce the geodetic record of slow slip that we observe to be dominated by subdaily fault slip dynamics. However, a simple linear model cannot accommodate the complex dynamics present throughout the slow slip cycle, and an analysis of different phases of the slow slip cycle shows that the ratio of geodetic to seismic fault slip varies as a function of time. This suggests that the low-frequency earthquake source region saturates as slow slip grows in moment and area. We propose that rheological heterogeneities at the plate boundary associated with low-frequency earthquakes do not play a significant role in the slow slip rupture process, thus implying that their activity is incidental to the driving aseismic slip."
