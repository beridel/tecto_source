Florent was with our group from February 2019 until November 2021.
He is now an R&D Data Scientist at GNS Science in Lower Hutt, New Zealand.
He is particularly interested in the detection and location of Earthquakes and
their interaction with what we call Slow-Earthquakes. He writes and maintains his own
codes to explore and analyze the extensive amount of seismic data that needs to be
treated. Florent uses signal processing, statistics and eventually machine learning, sometimes on HPC platform, to build/model seismic catalogs and study seismic-cycles along subduction zones such as New Zealand and Chile.
