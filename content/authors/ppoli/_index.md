Piero is a seismologist with experience in both earthquake source physics, and seismic tomography and imaging using the seismic ambient noise. 
His research is based on analysis of seismic data to understand the earthquake sources and the structure of the Earth. 
Piero is mainly interested in fault rheology and deformation style, rupture nucleation, induced microseismicity, rupture mechanism of deep and intermediate depth earthquakes, ambient noise for body wave recovery, imaging the core mantle boundary and mantle transition zone, seismic signal sonification, scattering and wave propagation.
