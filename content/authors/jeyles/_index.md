Jade is a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow working with Prof William Frank in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. She joined the EAPS department in June 2023, and will be working on her Marie Curie funded project 'TERRA' which will research seismicity recorded at Mt. Etna over the past 20 years, with the aim to understand how this is related to eruptive style and duration. Previously, Jade was an assistant teaching fellow at Imperial College London supporting and teaching several modules on the Geology and Geophysics programs. Her PhD at the University of East Anglia focussed on improving earthquake locations on the island of Montserrat to aid monitoring Soufri√®re Hills Volcano. This research compared over 25 years of volcanic seismicity to understand more about the volcanic plumbing system during the early stages of the eruption.
