Qingyu Wang joined the Frank group as a research associate since Nov, 2020.
She is a seismologist working on understanding the crustal deformation in the subduction zone beneath Japan. During the PhD at ISTerre (France), her research topic was to monitor the changes in the physical properties of the crust beneath Japan using ambient seismic noise-based monitoring technology. The measured seismic velocity changes are subject to external forcing changes such as the hydrological effects and internal forcing produced by such as different earthquakes. She focuses on the changes of the crustal state before and after the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and finds both dynamic and static strain related seismic velocity reduction. After receiving her PhD from ISTerre, France, she works at ISTerre as a postdoc researcher in 2019 and junior researcher in 2020 on interpreting the 4D tomography beneath Japan. By calculating the different coda waves sensitivity kernels based on the radiative transfer equation model, she can better localize both changes in scattering properties and physical properties in the crust and follow their different evaluation with time. Precise spatial localization is meaningful for a better understanding of the crustal stress state under various impacts.

Now Qingyu works on the Low-frequency earthquakes in the Nankai region in Japan. The primary goal is to understand why Low-frequency earthquakes are low frequency?
