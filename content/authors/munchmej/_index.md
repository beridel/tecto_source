Jannes is a visiting Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow working with Prof William Frank and visiting EAPS from June to December 2024.
Within the project DECODE, Jannes works on understanding seismic-aseismic interaction in subduction zone.
To this end, he is developing and applying machine learning methods for the detection of low-frequency earthquakes.
Previously, Jannes worked on earthquake rupture predictability, real time assessment of earthquakes, and machine learning methods for earthquake detection.
He is a developer and maintainer of the [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench) library, an open-source framework for machine learning in seismology.
