William Frank is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences](https://eapsweb.mit.edu) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu).
He leads the Tectonophysics research group that focuses on crustal deformation within the solid Earth, whether it's the result of earthquakes or the slow shear of slow slip.
