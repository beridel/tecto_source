Sofia is a PhD student majoring in geophysics at MIT EAPS in the Tectonophysics group in 2024. Her research implements detection and location techniques of tremors and links them to deformational processes in the uppermost part of the crust. She is currently working on ambient tremor detection on the Caribbean coast, implementing Backprojection techniques.
