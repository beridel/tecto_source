abstract = {Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are detected within tremor, as small, repetitive, impulsive low-frequency (1--8 Hz) signals. While the mechanism causing this depletion of the high-frequency content of their signal is still debated, this feature may indicate that the source processes at the origin of LFEs are different from those for regular earthquakes. Key constraints on the LFE-generating physical mechanisms can be obtained by establishing scaling laws between their seismic moment and source durations. Here we apply a simple spectral analysis method to the S-waveforms of LFEs from Guerrero, Mexico to measure their seismic moments and corner frequencies, a proxy to source duration. We find characteristic values of $M_0 \sim$ 3 x 10$^{12}$ N.m ($M_w \sim$ 2.3) and $f_c \sim$ 3.0 Hz with the corner frequency very weakly dependent on the seismic moment. This moment-duration scaling observed for Mexican LFE is similar to one previously reported in Cascadia and is very different from the established one for regular earthquakes. This suggests that they could be generated by sources of nearly constant size with strongly varying intensities. LFEs do not exhibit the self-similarity characteristic of regular earthquakes, suggesting that the physical mechanisms at their origin could be intrinsically different.},

journal = {Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth},
abstract={The 2014 Iquique seismic crisis in Chile, culminating with a $M_w$ 8.1 earthquake on 1 April, highlights a complex unlocking of the Northern Chilean subduction that has been considered a seismic gap since 1877. During the year preceding this event, at least three clusters of seismic activity have been reported: in July 2013 and January and March 2014. Recent studies have proposed large-scale slab deformation as a potential trigger for the megathrust earthquake, and these clusters possibly indicate aseismic slip transients accompanying the progressive destabilization of the plate contact. However, no evidence of gradual unlocking of the interface or transient deformation has yet been found in the seismicity rate. To address this question, we develop a dense earthquake catalog covering 15 months preceding the mainshock and derived from the continuous waveform data set recorded by the Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) and Iquique Local Network (ILN) networks. After declustering the seismicity, a space-time analysis highlights a large-scale acceleration of the seismicity along the interface accompanied by a deceleration of intermediate-depth earthquakes. We demonstrate the existence of a seismic quiescence downdip of the mainshock rupture before the July 2013 cluster. We propose that this seismic quiescence potentially highlights fluid circulation and/or aseismic motion along upper-plate crustal fault(s).},

abstract={To first order, faults are locked while stress builds up to a devastating earthquake. However, we know that faults also slip slowly. After decades of geophysical observation, slow slip is now recognized as part of a continuum of transient deformation ranging from the dynamic propagation of seismic rupture to aseismic events over a wide range of durations and sizes. A growing body of evidence suggests that large-scale slow slip events can be decomposed into a multitude of smaller, temporally clustered events. Slow slip is more frequent and more dynamic than is suggested by conceptual models of rate-strengthening, stable slip.},

abstract={We present a new automated earthquake detection and location method based on beamforming (or back projection) and template matching and apply it to study the seismicity of the Southwestern Alps. We use beamforming with prior knowledge of the 3-D variations of seismic velocities as a first detection run to search for earthquakes that are used as templates in a subsequent matched-filter search. Template matching allows us to detect low signal-to-noise ratio events and thus to obtain a high spatiotemporal resolution of the seismicity in the Southwestern Alps. We describe how we address the problem of false positives in energy-based earthquake detection with supervised machine learning and how to best leverage template matching to iteratively refine the templates and the detection. We detected 18,754 earthquakes over 1 year (our catalog is available online) and observed temporal clustering of the earthquake occurrence in several regions. This statistical study of the collective behavior of earthquakes provides insights into the mechanisms of earthquake occurrence. Based on our observations, we infer the mechanisms responsible for the seismic activity in three regions of interest: the Ubaye valley, the Brian\c{c}onnais, and the Dora Maira massif. Our conclusions point to the importance of fault interactions to explain the earthquake occurrence in the Brian\c{c}onnais and the Dora Maira massif, whereas fluids seem to be the major driving mechanism in the Ubaye valley.}

abstract={Slow slip transients on faults can last from seconds to months and stitch together the earthquake cycle. However, no single geophysical instrument is able to observe the full range of slow slip because of bandwidth limitations. Here, we connect seismic and geodetic data from the Mexican subduction zone to explore an instrumental blind spot. We establish a calibration of the daily median amplitude of the seismically recorded low-frequency earthquakes to the daily geodetically recorded moment rate of previously established slow slip events. This calibration allows us to use the precise evolution of low-frequency earthquake activity to quantitatively measure the moment of smaller, subdaily slip events that are unresolvable by geodesy alone. The resulting inferred slow slip moments scale with duration and inter-event time like ordinary earthquakes. These new quantifications help connect slow and fast events in a broad spectrum of transient slip and suggest that slow slip events behave much like ordinary earthquakes.}

abstract={We report new observations of triggered tectonic tremor in three regions in South America along the plate boundary between the Nazca and South America plates: southern Chile, Ecuador, and central Colombia. In these regions, tremor was observed during the passage of large-amplitude surface waves of recent large earthquakes, which occurred in South America and around the world. In southern Chile, triggered tremor was observed around an ambient tremor active zone in the Chile triple junction region. In Ecuador and central Colombia, only one seismic station in each region recorded triggered tremor. With a single-station approach, we are able to estimate potential tremor sources in these regions. Triggered tremor in Ecuador is likely associated with an inland fault near the volcanic region. In central Colombia, triggered tremor may be associated with the Romeral fault system rather than the subduction zone interface. In addition, we summarize global observations of tremor-triggering stress and background ambient tremor activity in 24 tremor-active regions. Based on the global summary of triggered and ambient tremor activity, the relative lack of triggered tremor in central and northern Chile and Peru is consistent with the lack of background tremor activity in these regions, suggesting tectonic tremor occurs only in isolated regions along major faults.}

This model is able to capture most of the features of aftershock migration such as the increase of the aftershock region as the logarithm of time and the observed aftershock migration velocities. When applied to the aftershock sequence of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, our model is able to describe the expansion of the aftershock region in both strike and dip directions together with the observed variations of migration velocities.}

abstract={We develop a single-station tremor spectrum template detection method that we applied to continuous seismic data recorded by the Mexican National Seismological Service broadband stations. This allows for an unprecedented long-term analysis of tectonic tremor in Mexico over multiple slow slip events (SSEs). We only detect tremor that are within previously discovered tremor regions, thereby extending the catalog in time but not space. The resulting catalog demonstrates the strong correlation of bursts of tremor activity and aseismic slip over multiple slow slip cycles. The $M \sim$ 7 long-term SSEs in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca are associated with the longest sequences of tremor bursts. Each of these tremor bursts are made up of a series of smaller bursts. In between the large $M 7$ SSEs, there are shorter-duration, isolated tremor bursts. In Guerrero, these shorter bursts were found to accompany $M \sim$ 6 short-term SSEs. The occurrence of these short-duration tremor bursts in Oaxaca demonstrates that small short-term SSEs occur in both major slow slip regions in Mexico. The discrete range of tremor burst sizes and rates suggests that slow slip events in the Mexican subduction zone are organized into characteristic moment and moment rates. The catalog also reveals other aseismic transients, such as postseismic slip in Oaxaca after the 16 February 2018 $M_w$ 7.2 Pinotepa Nacional earthquake. We highlight that such long-term catalogs are a useful tool together with geodetic observations to monitor slow slip activity that potentially plays a role in the subduction megathrust cycle.}

abstract={After lying dormant for 36 yr, the Tolbachik volcano of the Klyuchevskoy group started to erupt on 27 November 2012. We investigate the preparatory phase of this eruption via a statistical analysis of the temporal behavior of long-period (LP) earthquakes that occurred beneath this volcanic system. The LP seismicity occurs close to the surface beneath the main volcanic edifices and at 30 km depth in the vicinity of a deep magmatic reservoir. The deep LP earthquakes and those beneath the Klyuchevskoy volcano occur quasi-periodically, while the LP earthquakes beneath Tolbachik are clustered in time. As the seismicity rate increased beneath Tolbachik days before the eruption, the level of the time clustering decreased. We interpret this as a manifestation of the evolution of the volcano plumbing system. We suggest that when a plumbing system awakes after quiescence, multiple cracks and channels are reactivated simultaneously and their interaction results in the strong time clustering of LP earthquakes. With time, this network of channels and cracks evolves into a more stable state with an overall increased permeability, where fluids flow uninhibited throughout the plumbing system except for a few remaining impediments that continue to generate seismic radiation. The inter-seismic source interaction and the level of earthquake time clustering in this latter state is weak. This scenario suggests that the observed evolution of the statistical behavior of the shallow LP seismicity beneath Tolbachik is an indicator of the reactivation and consolidation of the near-surface plumbing system prior to the Tolbachik eruption. The parts of the plumbing system above the deep magmatic reservoir and beneath the Klyuchevskoy volcano remain in nearly permanent activity, as demonstrated by the continuous occurrence of the deep LP earthquakes and very frequent Klyuchevskoy eruptions. This implies that these parts of the plumbing system remain in a stable permeable state and contain a few weakly interacting seismogenic sources. Our results provide new constraints on future mechanical models of the magmatic plumbing systems and demonstrate that the level of time clustering of LP earthquakes can be a useful parameter to infer information about the state of the plumbing system.}

Using a dense catalog of low-frequency earthquakes as a guide, we investigate the $M_w$ 7.5 slow slip event that occurred in 2006 along the subduction interface 40 km beneath Guerrero, Mexico. We show that while the long-period surface displacement, as recorded by Global Positioning System, suggests a 6-month duration, the motion in the direction of tectonic release only sporadically occurs over 55 days, and its surface signature is attenuated by rapid relocking of the plate interface. Our proposed description of slow slip as a cluster of slow transients forces us to re-evaluate our understanding of the physics and scaling of slow earthquakes.}

abstract={Aftershocks region have been extensively reported to expand logarithmically with time. The associated migration velocity is typically of the order of several km/decade but can be much larger, especially when observing early aftershock sequences, seismic swarms, or tremors. We present here a model for the expansion of aftershock zones based on the idea that aftershocks are triggered as afterslip grows with time along the fault. One of the model assumptions is that aftershocks are triggered when a critical level of afterslip is reached. We predict that the migration velocity $V_p$ at time $t$ following the mainshock is given by $V_p = \zeta \frac{A'}{\delta\tau}\times \frac{c}{t}$, where $A'$ is a frictional parameter, $\delta\tau$ a characteristic value for the stress perturbation, $c$ the radius of the stress perturbation, and $\zeta$ a constant of order unity. The scaling $V_p = 1/t$ implies a logarithmic expansion of the aftershock zone with time. The migration velocities predicted by our model are in quantitative agreement with the observations reported following aftershock sequence of small and large earthquakes in various tectonic settings, seismic swarms, and tremor sequences.}

They operate via an algorithm that computes the correlation coefficient between a template event and a sliding window of continuous seismic records. A detection is recorded when the correlation coefficient crosses an established threshold. We present an optimized program, called Fast Matched Filter (FMF), that efficiently runs a network-based matched-filter search with either central processing units (CPUs) or Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). Wrappers for both Python and MATLAB (CPU only) are provided to easily run FMF on a wide range of computational resources, from multicore laptops to specialized computing clusters with GPUs. Both implementations leverage a significantly similar structure when it comes to the continuous computation of correlation coefficients in the time domain to achieve rapid performance. The highly parallel architecture of GPUs lends itself perfectly to the matched-filter algorithm, and we achieve the fastest run times with our GPU implementation. FMF allows for seismic network-based matched-filtering between a large set of template waveforms and a large continuous dataset in a reasonable amount of time. Such fast run times are an important step in expanding the scope of earthquake detection and fostering the reproducibility of such studies.}

abstract={We adapt matched-filter searching to a region of sparse stations and seismicity, and demonstrate that earthquake detection can be significantly enhanced. The Earthscope Transportable Array (TA) increased the density of broadband seismometers in New England from 2013 until 2015, allowing for a higher resolution characterization of the regional seismicity. During this time, there were two transient increases in seismicity rates in Connecticut: one in August 2014 near the town of Deep River and one shortly after in January 2015 near Plainfield. Using the TA stations along with regional permanent stations, we implement a network-based matched-filter search to find events that have escaped previous detection during these bursts of seismicity. Applying a matched-filter approach in a region of sparse seismicity with a distributed regional network presents two challenges. First, a standard matched-filter search imposes a fixed template event duration across the seismic network; this constraint is not appropriate for the waveforms of shallow crustal seismicity that vary significantly with epicentral distance. We adapt the matched-filter algorithm to produce a network correlation coefficient sum that is properly weighted by the duration of the seismic wavetrain that varies across the network. Second, the low seismicity means there are few events to use as templates. We develop a recursive method to expand the catalog using newly identified earthquakes as template events in the following iteration of the matched-filter search. With these improvements in place, we are able to implement a matched-filter search that identifies three times more events than the regional catalog. Thanks to our denser catalog and precise relative locations, we observe an aftershock sequence following an $M$ 2.6 mainshock near Deep River and a swarmlike sequence without any clear mainshock in Plainfield.}

abstract={Since the discovery of slow slip events, many methods have been successfully applied to model obvious transient events in geodetic time series, such as the widely used network strain filter. Independent seismological observations of tremors or low-frequency earthquakes and repeating earthquakes provide evidence of low-amplitude slow deformation but do not always coincide with clear occurrences of transient signals in geodetic time series. Here we aim to extract the signal corresponding to slow slips hidden in the noise of GPS time series, without using information from independent data sets. We first build a library of synthetic slow slip event templates by assembling a source function with Green's functions for a discretized fault. We then correlate the templates with postprocessed GPS time series. Once the events have been detected in time, we estimate their duration $T$ and magnitude $M_w$ by modeling a weighted stack of GPS time series. An analysis of synthetic time series shows that this method is able to resolve the correct timing, location, $T$ , and $M_w$ of events larger than $M_w$ 6 in the context of the Mexico subduction zone. Applied on a real data set of 29 GPS time series in the Guerrero area from 2005 to 2014, this technique allows us to detect 28 transient events from $M_w$ 6.3 to 7.2 with durations that range from 3 to 39 days. These events have a dominant recurrence time of 40 days and are mainly located at the downdip edges of the $M_w >$ 7.5 slow slip events.}

abstract={Low Frequency Earthquakes (LFEs) often occur in conjunction with transient strain episodes, or Slow Slip Events (SSEs), in subduction zones. Their focal mechanism and location consistent with shear failure on the plate interface argue for a model where LFEs are discrete dynamic ruptures in an otherwise slowly slipping interface. SSEs are mostly observed by surface geodetic instruments with limited resolution and it is likely that only the largest ones are detected. The time synchronization of LFEs and SSEs suggests that we could use the recorded LFEs to constrain the evolution of SSEs, and notably of the geodetically-undetected small ones. However, inferring slow slip rate from the temporal evolution of LFE activity is complicated by the strong temporal clustering of LFEs. Here we apply dedicated statistical tools to retrieve the temporal evolution of SSE slip rates from the time history of LFE occurrences in two subduction zones, Mexico and Cascadia, and in the deep portion of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield. We find temporal characteristics of LFEs that are similar across these three different regions. The longer term episodic slip transients present in these datasets show a slip rate decay with time after the passage of the SSE front possibly as $t^{-1/4}$. They are composed of multiple short term transients with steeper slip rate decay as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ between 1.4 and 2. We also find that the maximum slip rate of SSEs has a continuous distribution. Our results indicate that creeping faults host intermittent deformation at various scales resulting from the imbricated occurrence of numerous slow slip events of various amplitudes.}

abstract={The postseismic deformation following a large ($M_w  >$ 7) earthquake is expressed both seismically and aseismically. Recent studies have appealed to a model that suggests that the aseismic slip on the plate interface following the mainshock can be the driving factor in aftershock sequences, reproducing both the geodetic (afterslip) and seismic (aftershocks) observables of postseismic deformation. Exploiting this model, we demonstrate how a dense catalog of aftershocks following the 2015 $M_w$ 8.3 Illapel earthquake in Central Chile can constrain the frictional and rheological properties of the creeping regions of the subduction interface. We first expand the aftershock catalog via a 19 month continuous matched-filter search and highlight the log-time expansion of seismicity following the mainshock, suggestive of afterslip as the main driver of aftershock activity. We then show how the time history of aftershocks can constrain the temporal evolution of afterslip. Finally, we use our dense aftershock catalog to estimate the rate and state rheological parameter $(a ? b) \sigma$ as a function of depth and demonstrate that this low value is compatible either with a nearly velocity-neutral friction ($a \approx b$) in the regions of the megathrust that host afterslip, or an elevated pore fluid pressure (low effective normal stress $\sigma$) along the plate interface. Our results present the first snapshot of rheology in depth together with the evolution of the tectonic stressing rate along a plate boundary. The framework described here can be generalized to any tectonic context and provides a novel way to constrain the frictional properties and loading conditions of active faults.}

In such a way, previously undetected slow slip events that produce less than a millimeter of surface deformation are extracted from the geodetic noise. These new observations demonstrate that the interaseismic period is not quiescent and that slow slip occurs much more often than previously thought. This suggests that the plate interface where slow slip and tremor occur is in fact strongly coupled and that slow aseismic release occurs over a wide spectrum of time scales.}

We show that while the plate interface remains locked, LFEs behave as a simple Poisson process, whereas they become strongly clustered in time during even the smallest slow slip, consistent with interaction between different LFE sources.

We apply an automatic burst detection algorithm to the LFE recurrence times to identify the clustering behaviour of LFEs (LFE bursts) in each family. We find that the burst behaviours in the northern and southern LFE groups differ. Generally, the northern group has longer burst duration but fewer LFEs per burst, while the southern group has shorter burst duration but more LFEs per burst. The southern group LFE bursts are generally more correlated than the northern group, suggesting more coherent deep fault slip and relatively simpler deep fault structure beneath the locked section of SAF. We also found that the 2004 Parkfield earthquake clearly increased the number of LFEs per burst and average burst duration for both the northern and the southern groups, with a relatively larger effect on the northern group. This could be due to the weakness of northern part of the fault, or the northwesterly rupture direction of the Parkfield earthquake.}

By aligning GPS time series with episodes of low-frequency earthquake activity and stacking, we identify a repeating transient slip event that generates a displacement at the surface that is hidden under noise prior to stacking. Our results suggest that the geodetic investigation of transient slip guided by seismological information is essential in exploring the spectrum of fault slip.}

abstract={Slow earthquakes are important constituents of the seismic cycle and are involved in the stress transfer between the viscously slipping portion of the plate interface and the seismogenic zone. Their occurrence is likely associated with the near-lithostatic pore pressure in the slow earthquake source region, where fluids might modify fault friction and whose presence is indicated by high ratios of compressional (P)?wave velocity to shear (S)?wave velocity observed at the interface between the subducting plate and the overlying crust. Here we compare two slow earthquake phenomena observed in the Guerrero region of the Mexican subduction zone: low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) and a slow-slip event (SSE) recorded by GPS. We observe variations of the LFE occurrence rates over month-long time scales during a large SSE that we interpret as a manifestation of transient changes in the fault shear strength. We argue that these transient changes are caused by a pore pressure fluctuation that migrates updip along the subduction interface. This mechanism suggests that fluids do not only passively weaken the plate interface but also play an active role in slow earthquake source regions.}

abstract={Studies of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) have focused on detecting events within previously identified tectonic tremor. However, the principal LFE detection tools of matched-filter searches are intrinsically incapable of detecting events that have not already been characterized previously as a template event. In this study, we therefore focus on generating the largest number possible of LFE templates by uniformly applying a recently developed LFE template detection method to a 2.5 yearlong data set in Guerrero, Mexico. Using each of the detected templates in a matched-filter search, we then form event families that each represents a single source. We finally develop simple, empirical statistics to select the event families that represent LFEs. Our resulting catalog contains 1120 unique LFE sources and a total of 1,849,486 detected LFEs over the 2.5 year-long data set. The locations of the LFE sources are then divided into subcatalogs based on their distance from the subduction trench. Considering each LFE as a small unit of slip along the subduction interface, we observe discrete episodes of LFE activity in the region associated with large slow-slip events; this is in direct contrast to the near-continuous activity observed 35 km farther downdip within the previously identified LFE/tremor sweet spot.}

abstract={Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs), which frequently originate from multiplet-generating sources that are closely linked with tectonic tremor in subduction zones around the world, are difficult to observe and characterize due to their low signal-to-noise ratios. This obstacle can be sidestepped by detecting and then stacking all of the multiplets of a master LFE event, or template, using a matched-filter search; the difficulty however lies in finding an LFE event to use as a template. We implement here an automated beamforming algorithm to detect LFEs within the Mexican subduction zone that can then be used as templates in a matched-filter search. Seismograms recorded on a network of seismic stations are aligned to match the moveout of a potential source at depth and their energies are then summed; any spikes in the summed energy indicate an event originating from that potential source. We apply this method to a 1-d test case and we are able to detect 381 unique, potential LFE templates. We then compare our method to a previously introduced LFE detection scheme based on multiplet correlations for three test cases and find that the two methods are complementary.}

abstract={We use data from the Meso-America Subduction Experiment to detect and locate low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) in the Mexican subduction zone. We use visually-identified templates to perform a network waveform correlation search that produced $\sim$17,000 robustly detected LFEs that form 15 distinct families. Stacking an LFE family's corresponding detections results in seismograms with high signal-to-noise ratios and clear P and S wave arrivals; we use these travel times to locate the sources. The resulting locations superpose a previously identified region of permanent non-volcanic tremor (NVT) activity. Husker et al. (2012) called this region a Sweet Spot, suggesting that the local conditions are adequate to continuously generate NVT. The LFE hypocenters have been located at a depth of 40--45?km in an area that is surrounding the upper slab-plate interface. We characterize their focal mechanisms by comparing their stacked seismograms to synthetic seismograms. This analysis reveals a common low-dipping focal mechanism.}
